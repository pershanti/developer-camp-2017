## Matches

Matching comes from filling out the profile during the onboarding flow. 

After a user fills out a profile, we show them the matching pups. 

Matching is determined by: 
- distance from the user, 
- weight/size of the dog, 
- Vaccinated -- applicable only if <1 year old
- Temperament (energy, social) 



- The user should be able to filter the matches by:
  - Distance: 5mi, 10mi, 15mi
  
  - Breed (optional ?)
  - Neuter/Spay
